In this project, we have created a clone of the game Stick Hero, by Ketchapp.
We have utilised various concept of Object-Oriented Programming, such as Polymorphism, Inheritance,
and Design Patterns.

To Run the code, follow the following steps:

1) Navigate to the directory where the folder is stored, using Terminal
2) Type mvn javafx:run
3) Press Enter

 To run the tests, navigate to the terminal and type 'mvn test' in the project directory.

The Design Patters we have used are :

1) Singleton: For storing the progress information

2) Factory: For creating cherries and pillars.
